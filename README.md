# Coffee Compass
Coffee Compass is a 4 page website that allows users to find coffee shops near them, navigate to them and provides entertainment in the form of a game while they wait for the coffee. They can also keep track of where they went to, what they ordered and how they rated the service by adding it to the website DOM.

The goal of this project is to showcase the different technologies I used in this project such as google API’s, HTML, CSS and my knowledge of Vanilla Javascript.

## UX

### Strategy
My UX strategy is to design a website for users who want to find cool coffee shops near them that they didn’t know before. It also allows them to play a fun game while waiting for their coffee and when they have their coffee they are then able to write a little note and a review for next time to remind themselves of where they have been, what they ordered and the rating of the service out of 10. 
The layout will contain 4 pages. 
The first being an instructional page, the second the maps allowing the user to find a coffee shop near their current location, the 3rd being the rock paper scissors game (with a twist) and lastly the review page where the user is able to leave a review for themselves to remind them of where they were the last time.

## User Stories
- As a User, I must have clear instructions on how to use the website
- As a User, I must be able to search for any coffee shop near my locations
- As a User, I must be able to use the website from my mobile with ease
- As a User, I must have an option play a game while I wait for my coffee
- As a User, I must be able to leave a personal review for each place that I’ve been to so that I can know where I have gone to and where I haven’t gone to,how the service was and what I ordered every time I’ve gone there.


## Features
- Mobile friendly
- Search for coffee shops/cafes near me and also see the star ratings, address and name of the shop
- Play rock, lizard, spock paper and scissors while you wait and see the score be updated in the DOM as you play
- Write a review and store it to the DOM.

### Features to impliment
- Local storage of the review to the DOM once it get's posted
- Add directions to the google map so that users can navigate to the cafe/coffee shop without leaving the website

## Testing
- I've implemented Jasmine Testing for the Rock Paper Scissors game and all tests have passed the required tests.
- I ran the CSS through a CSS checker and no errors found [CSS Checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- I ran the code through a HTML checker and no errors found with only warnings for no "H" titles in certain sectiona elements. This was left empty due to them being dymanically filled with Javascript. [HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#l96c39)
- There were nono errors found when running the Javascript through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) only warnings that I was using ES6 that may not be compatable to all browsers.
